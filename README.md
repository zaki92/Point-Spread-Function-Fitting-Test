Point-Spread-Function-Fitting-Test

Given a tab delimited text file having values of x, y ,z and f(x,y,z), 
hypothesize that the f(x,y,z) ~ 3D gaussian. Find of best parameters of the 3D 
gaussian using a steepest descent algorithm - this is a manual check of the 
output of a new image analysis program for a new lattice light field microscope
Input: 
    Tab delimited file, having values of x, y, z, and f(x,y,z)
    
Output: 
    3D Gaussian Parameters, comparitive plots (with options to generate test data).
